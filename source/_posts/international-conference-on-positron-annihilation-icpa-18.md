The goal of the conference is to provide a platform for positron researchers from all over the world to present their latest research results, communicate new ideas with colleagues face to face, and to find partners for future collaboration. The conference proceedings will be published in a peer review journal, and the official language of the conference will be English.

Positron school will also be held on August 19, prior to our first conference gathering that evening. The goal of the school is to introduce the basics of the positron techniques to scientists from interdisciplinary areas as well as to students and young scientists in positron fields.
