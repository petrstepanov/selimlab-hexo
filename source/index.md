        <p>Dr. Selim has a broad research program in the field of oxides and wide band gap materials. Her research covers a wide range of topics in semiconductors and dielectrics including synthesis, thin film technology, optoelectronics, transport properties, and defect studies. She is expert on positron annihilation and luminescence spectroscopies and has been very active in developing new techniques and building instrumentation for defect and luminescence measurements.</p>
        <p>Selim has earned international recognition in a number of scientific communities that has been reflected in selecting her to be:</p>
