Doppler broadening of annihilation radiation is a powerful method for studying point defects in materials. At SelimLab we have a fully digital spectrometer that utilizes Canberra's Ge high purity detectors and LYNX digital signal analyzers. Facility outputs two-dimentional spectra that represent pairs of photon energy events, registered simultaneously.

We developed a special software that processes 2D energy spectrum and outputs 1D doppler-broadened spectrum. Sharing is caring. Enjoy!

* Supports the file format output by Canberra's TLIST Data Scanner app.
* Fits and subtracts the background sleeves related to three-gamma annihilation events.
* The good old method of filtering the events on the diagonal is implemented.
* Exports doppler-broadened E1-E2 spectrum.
* Saves raster graphic images.
