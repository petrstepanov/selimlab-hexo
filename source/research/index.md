        <div class="spacer-4em hidden-xs"></div>
        <p>We explore novel physical phenomena such as the formation of 2DEG and giant photoconductivity  induced in  multifunctional complex oxides by generating and tuning point defects at the interfaces.</p>
        <p>Following epitaxial growth by MOCVD or ALD, defects  are populated by photo- and thermal processing using our unique gas mixing panel with atomic precision control.</p>

## Positron annihilation spectroscopy

We developed the first fully digital Coincidence Doppler broadening spectrometer. It is expected to greatly improve the sensitivity of Doppler broadening in probing the electron momentum distributions and identifying the chemical environment around defects.

Our lab hosts a positron lifetime spectrometer and a coincident Doppler broadening system that provide crucial tools  for defect studies and assist us in revealing the source of many interesting phenomena.
